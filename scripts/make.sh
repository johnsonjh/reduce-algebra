# sub-directories suitable for the architecture of the current machine.
# This means it will not be very good if you try to set up
# cross-compilation! In that case you must select the relevant directory
# to run the cross build for yourself.

# Note that this tries to identify all potentially relevent build
# directories that contain a "Makefile", that being used as a signature
# that they have been configured. It allows for suffixes "-m32" "-m64"
# and "-debug" as in scripts/findhost.sh.

# It also tries to build both CSL and PSL setups when they have been
# configured.
