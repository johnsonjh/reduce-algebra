# To try to make things behave better on machines where the versions of
# autoconf and automake are not the same as the ones I run, this will
# commit a set of changes but will NOT commit files whose names are in
# the list "gen" below - and that is intended to be a list of things
# regenerated by autotconf etc.
#
# The idea is that the first time somebody checks stuff out they get a full
# set of ready-to-go versions of Makefile.in and confiure and the rest.
# When they go "make" then there is a fair chance that autoconf will be
# reinvoked for them and they will get locally customised versions. When the
# central set of files updates (eg) configure.ac then that but none of the
# files derived from it gets updated (usually!) so the users will need to have
# the automatic regeneration done.  There are long stories about why this is
# the best idea I have at present about how to minimise global pain!

# Before I do anything else I will update revision numbers
# I want this script to be one I can launch from anywhere, but at least
# some of its sub-scripts will not be so generous. So find out where it
# lives so that other locations can be found relative to that.
