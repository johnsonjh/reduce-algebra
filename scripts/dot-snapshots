This is a prototype and demonstration ".snapshots" file. The machine
names and addreses used here are relevant to me, but not to anybody else,
so you will need to adapt it to your own needs before using it.
The machine names shown are in general the ones reported by "uname -n".

# $HOME/.snapshots

# A C Norman, 2019

# This file customises the Reduce snapshot builder by indicating private
# or local machines that can be used for building snapshots. For each
# system for which a snapshot may be generated there is a function here
# called "hosts_<architecture>". This can test the identify of the machine
# it is running on (so that a user can put exactly the same .snapshots files
# on multiple computers - I expect that this will generally simplify
# maintenance). It then sets a variable MODE together with some further
# variables.

# It can use this to override the snapshot building regime for macintosh,
# windows, linux32 (ie i686), linux64 (ie x86_64) and rpi (ie a Raspberry Pi
# running 32-bit Raspbian). It does not need to override all of these.
# So a very simple file content would be if a Windows machine was available
# as a server, but otherwise default behaviour was wanted. In that case this
# file might contain just
#     hosts_windows() {
#       MODE=ssh
#       HOST=windows.machine.some.network
#     }
# where the HOST setting gives the network identity of the Windows server -
# which will be accessed using ssh.
#
# It is possible to set PORT here to indicate a port to be used in redirection
# when accessing a virtual machine. However doing so is not especially
# recommended because the main script takes steps to choose a port that
# it has just detected as not being in use.
#
# When remote systems are accessed using ssh it is required that public key
# authentication without the need for further manual intervention is set up so
# that commends such as
#     ssh remote.host.machine some-command
# are executed without any need to quote further passwords. This may be
# achieved using the .ssh/authorized_keys scheme and possibly using the
# ssh-agent. 
#
# More elaborate options are illustrated in what follows:

case `uname -n` in

# at the time of writing this, recently gone beyond support) in the hope
# that binaries created on that will work on any later system.
# To build on such a release of Linux I needed to take special steps to
# install various newer software tools:
# (1) I identified extra software repositories from which I could
#     install a series 5 release of gcc/g++. Specifically I use a
#     repository ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-toolchain-r/test/ubuntu in
#     dists/precise.
# (2) I fetch source archives of (gnu) make, autoconf, automake, libtool
#     and rsync from the nearest GNU mirror, and in each case go
#     ./configure --prefix=/usr; make; sudo make install
# to replace older system-provided versions.
#
# Note: scripts/ubuntu-sanity-check.sh now performs (1) as part of its
# regular processing, while for (2) an easy scheme is to unpack the
# archive csl/support-packages/necessary-updates.tar.bz2 into a fairly
# arbitrary directy and then run the "build-them.sh" script included in it.
#
# If you build on a more modern Linux release you may not need all that!
