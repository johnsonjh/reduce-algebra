// Overview of procedure for full garbage collection:
//
// I have Pages (8M) and Chunks (16K). Pinning is at a granularity of Chunks.
//
// Pinning whole chunks rather than individual objects is a policy I am
// following to reduce the cost of identifying what needs to be pinned.
// Very very preliminary measurements suggests that I may end up with
// around 1% of my memory in pinned Chunks. It looks as if (for a given
// calculation) the number of pinned pages may not change dramatically
// as memory is enlarged, so with extra memory the proportion of Pages
// holding pinned Chunks will tend to shrink.
//
// First I will provide a reminder of the fields and data involved in
// pinning things.
//
// When a page has pinned regions within it its chunkCount field will be
// non-zero, because the pinned regsions will be represented as Chunks.
// When testing if an ambiguous pointer is pinned I will arrange that the
// chunkMap be sorted so I can identify the Chunk that an address is within
// using binary search.
// A field chunkMapSorted is used to avoid too many repeat sorting steps.
// Binary search of chunkMap lets me identify a candidate Chunk for an
// ambiguous pointer and then pointsWithin() tests if the address is within
// the used data portion of that Chunk. If so an isPinned flag indicates
// whether the Chunk is a pinned one and when it first becomes pinned it is
// pushed on the pages pinnedChunks list using its pinChain field.
// When the first Chunk on a Page is pinned the hasPinned flag in the
// Page is set and the Page is pushed onto globalPinChain through its
// pinChain field.
// Note that the process of pinning something never creates a new Chunk, so
// the chunkMap just needs to be as established while allocation within the
// Page was happening, and the it only needs sorting once at the start of
// a GC.
// When at some later stage it is necessary to allocate within a Page that
// has some pinned Chunks the otherwise empty Page should end up with
// a chunkMap that only mentions the pinned Chunks. This is all dealt with
// in setUpUsedPage. the chunkMap is cleared and then re-created from the
// list pinnedChunks. That may leave it is an arbitrary order, so it is then
// sorted and with that done pinnedChunks can be re-created in ascending
// order. Then fringe and limit are set up within the Page. limit will
// point to the first pinned Chunk. That will have a length field indicating
// where there is free space beyond it and a pinChain entry that refers to
// the start of the next pinned Chunk (and hence the end of the free region).
//
// Pages are classified as BUSY, MOSTLYFREE or FREE and have a pageClass
// indicating which applies.
//
// Of the BUSY pages two will be specially identified - currentPage and
// previousPage, but all busy pages will be chained on busyPages. While
// the system is NOT in the garbage collector currentPage is where allocation
// is proceeding. Its limit may refer to the start of a pinned Chunk within
// it. As the GC is entered (and as it graduated to become previousPage)
// every Chunk will have its chunkFringe filled in to show the limit of
// valid material stored in it. This is in case the Chunk ends up pinned,
// in which case all objects stored in it will need to be treated as precise
// list bases - they are identified using a linear scan of the (active part
// of) the Chunk. At an earlier stage I had planned to put padder objects
// to full every chunk right up to the end, but by following the current
// plan I can arrange that when a pinned chunk survives garbage collection
// and ends up in a MostlyFree page it gets truncated down to its chunkFringe,
// and that avoids a bit of memory waste.
//
// MOSTLYFREE pages are chained on mostlyFreePages while FREE ones are on
// freePages.
//
// During early stages of Garbage Collection all BUSY pages and all MOSTLYFREE
// ones will need their chunkMaps. Neither need any pinChain information.
// At the time I sort the chunkMap (ie when I find the first pin in the
// Page) I must reset the isPinned flag on all Chunks in that page and
// chear the pinChain. Then while pinning a Chunk those two get updated.
// The situation after that is that I end up with a list of the Pages that
// contain pinned Chunks this time, and within each such Page I can identify
// those Chunks easily. 
//
// Now move busyPages to OldPages and set up a new CurrentPage. While
// performing a major GC always allocate a MOSTLYFREE page rather than a
// fully free one if possible. This is because doing to embeds the previously
// pinned data among newly copies data. Much of it is liable NOT to be
// pinned on the next garbage collection (because I hope that values on the
// stack will have changed by then). So by doing that the stuff pinned by the
// previous GC will have a chance to be fully recovered by the next one.
//
// Scan the stack (ie the "ambiguous bases") so that Chunks in OldPages and
// MostlyFree that are accessible via that collection of values are marked
// as pinned. Note that the only Chunks present in the MostlyFree pages will
// be ones that has been pinned last time, and so things there that are
// pinned now are "re-pinned".
//
// Hmm - there is a messy issue about my current plans - it is a worst-case
// matter not one liable to occur in any normal use.
// With my concurrent-allocation scheme there can be waste space due to
// fragmentation when the code attempts to allocate a large object. Suppose
// my target chunk-size is C and I first allocate single small item then
// try to allocate something of size C. It will not fit and I will have to
// allocate a fresh chunk. I have some lack of clarity in my mind about
// the consequences of size-choice for the new chunk, but if it either JUST
// fits the new object (and I then allocate yet another standard-sized new
// chunk beyond it or it the new chunk is object-size+C I think we end up
// with an occupancy of around 50%.
// Now suppose that ordinary operation has by magic achieved perfect packing
// but the GC (while copying into its new space) suffers worst-case
// fragmentation. It gums up unless GC was triggered when total system
// memory was (1/3) full. One can not afford to wait until it is (1/2) full.
// With the scheme I have of Pages (8MB) and a limit I set at 2MB for any
// individual object I can have only 75% of a page occupied when a big
// vector will fail to fit at the end. That puts a limit at a bit over 42%
// and that applies in the system I had before this re-written GC.
// Well I now thing that if I put these together I spot that space wasted
// at the end of the Page will lead to a nice big contiguous block at the
// start of the next Page, and in the end my previous calculation that a
// major GC needs to be triggered when memory is (1/3) full stands.
//
// For statistical and evaluation purposes at this stage it will be
// interesting to see how many Pages contain pinned Chunks and both how
// many Chunks are involved and what proportion of the Pages concerned they
// use. That will be information I can gather before getting all the rest
// of the GC working!
//
// Evacution:
//   If the location to be evacuated holds immediate data do nothing,
//     otherwise it holds a pointer to some object.
//   If that object is to something in a MostlyFree page or one of the
//     pages I am at present allocating in then it must be to something that
//     had been pinned last time. So do nothing.
//   Now it is points into an oldPage. I must check if it is in a
//     pinned Chunk. Well at this stage I will have set things up so that
//     the ONLY Chunks in the chunkMap of such a page are the [newly] pinned
//     ones and I do not expoct there to be many, so binary search in the
//     chunkMap should be quick. If into a pinned chunk it is left alone.
//     That will be something that had been pinned both in a previous GC
//     (and hence ended up mingled with live data) and pinned again this
//     time.
//   If the CAR field of the object holds a forwarding address use that to
//     update the location to be a proper pointer to relocated data.
//     The item pointed at will need to be inspected to reconstruct the
//     proper tag bits for the adjusted reference. Done!
//   Make a (binary) copy of the object in the next free space within C.
//   Set the CAR field to be a forwarding address to the copy.
//
// Note that the copy will then (in due course) be scanned. For that to be
// feasible the Pages where I allocate copied material (including pinned
// Chunks embedded within them) must be such that I can perform a linear
// scan, so chunkFringe must be set up where relevent.
//
// My first version of the major GC will run sequentially, however in the
// future I hope to experiment with concurrency within it. So I will write
// this as for a parallel implementation, although for that the details
// above under "Evacuation" will need to be enhanced to allow for thread
// interlocks.
//
// The GC has two parts. In one - seeding - the precise list bases are
// evacuated. I will seed from all the static precise list bases (ie
// variables and arrays in the C++ code) and also from each item present in
// a pinned chunk.  This part is done in the master thread. I expect that the
// total number of items processed will be reasonably modest, but in the
// worst case there could be quite a lot of pinned material. An initial
// evaluation suggests that in a fairly heavy case I may evacuate around
// 100K items here - around (1/5) of a Page-full.
// From then on I need to scan and evacuate all copied material. I do that
// Chunk by Chunk, and when within a Page I find a Chunk tagged as with
// isPinned I know it has already been processed. I hope to distribute
// Chunks to different threads for processing, and then in the same way that
// multiple threads can allocate during normal use, each GC thread will
// have its own Chunk that it is copying material into.
// Apart from the administration of thread start-up that is fairly clean and
// easy! When any thread completes evacuating a chunk it needs to grab
// another. That will usually happen using an atomic increment instruction
// much as in storage allocation.
// There is then a significant complication towards the end of GC. When
// a thread completes filling up a chunk with evacuated data it will push
// that chunk onto a needsEvacuating chain. When it completes clearing a
// chunk then the cleared chunk can not be re-used yet. The thread tries
// to grab another from needsEvacuating. That list may be empty, and in
// that case it should start evacuating the Chunk it is currently evacuating
// within. If it catches up with the fringe there it needs to wait until
// a new chunk needs to be evacuated. Eventually every thread will be paused
// on that basis: the evacuation phase of GC will be complete. 
// Well I talk cheerily there of a chain of chunks recently filled by the
// evacuation process. In a single-thread world this does not need much
// because Chunks can be scanned sequentially through Pages. The relevent
// Pages will need to be chained but that is simple.
// In a multi-thread world this is much much less nice! I will certainly
// need a thread-safe process to identify the next sequential Chunk within
// a page. Well this feels like the need for a "lock free pop" but it is
// in the especially happy case that it traverses a chain that is not being
// updated, so the mess of the ABA problem does not arise.
// The uglier issue is that Chunks do not get completely filled sequentially,
// and so one could have the sequential scan needing to skip past (several)
// chunks that are in the process of being filled by other threads. A bad
// case for this might be if one thread is processing a chunk that contains
// references to very many rather large vectors - as it processes these it
// need to allocate additional Chunks (that will need scanning later). A
// different thread keeps performing a linear scan to find another Chunk
// to process - and gets as far as the now-in-use Chunk and has to skip past
// it. I think that means that a large number of Chunks could end up "left
// behind". These need to be recorded on a chain and a lock-free stack seems
// what is needed. Well if every completed Chunk is placed on this stack
// then the linear scan of Chunks is not needed. Note that every Chunk
// that is involved gets put on this stack just once and removed just once
// (per GC) so the ABA issue does not arise and implementing the stack can
// follow the recipe often characterised as "naive".
// The final mess is that to select a Chunk to scan it will be necessary
// to pop from the chain there and if that is empty to wait until either
// another Chunk is made available by some other thread or until every
// thread is also stalling.
// At this stage in the explanation I can adjust something said before: I
// need to seed from all pinned chunks. That can be done by just pushing
// those chunks ono the stack that I have just described and then their
// contents will be processed (potentially in a multi-threaded manner)
// as part of the normal scheme of things.




// Code for sorting "lists"...

// This is to sort some form of structure that is in abstract terms a list.
// The "list" is passed and returned an an item of type Concrete. This might
// but a type that is a pointer to a node object, or it could be "void *"
// where implementation details are being hidden from other parts of the
// code, or it might be "uintptr_t" and a handle for the start of the list.
// Abstract then needs to be a class that provides a collection of static
// methods to inspect and update the list. Because this sorts the list
// in-place there is no need for any storage allocation. I will expect that
// the Concrete type is small, so that creating an array of length 1000 will
// not strain stack-size.
