The revision of wxWidgets that I am using is from git on the above date.

This file records that fact and is used by "make" so that when its date
stamp changes a fresh copy of wxWidgets will be unpacked for use. There is
no check that the revision information quoted here matches the one that gets
unpacked, but the details included here guarantee a textual change in this
file any time I update things, and that means that date-stamps will change,
leading to rebuilding.
