// There are time when I want to write
//    inline thread_local T name = value;
// where the use of the "inline" qualifier is so that I can put this in
// a header file (including the case of a header-only library). The
// "thread_local" is just there for what it normally means.
//
// I have two problems with this. The first is that inline variables are
// only available from C++17 onwards and I still wish to support compilers
// that are not that up to date. The second is that fine-grain use of items
// declared thread_local leads to severe overheads under Cygwin and Mingw32.
// However on those platforms there is a Microsoft-specific scheme for
// thread-local support that has respectable performance, but which is
// limited to storing values as "void ".
//
// The code here is to abstract over my responses to all this. I used to have
// a more elaborate scheme where I had fallen into the C++ trap of using too
// many of its facilities all at once - templates, overloading rather basic
// operators etc etc. That version avoided use of "#define" and means that
// in the end the thread-local values I introduced could be referenced (almost)
// as if they were simmple variable. However when I came to debug code that
// used it each reference to such a variable made single-stepping my code
// really bad, and on at least one occasion it seemed to crash gdb. So this is
// a simpler scheme that puts less strain on the compiler's optimizer and
// is what I am trying now.  To use it one replaces the definition of any
// thread-local with
//     declare_thread_local(name, T);
// or  declare_thread_local_ref(name, T);
// and both of those are (more or less) substitutes for
//     inline thread_local T name;
// Note that in this scheme there is no support for initializing the variable
// at its point of definition. Then in the first case where "name" would have
// been used the rest of the code has to write name::get() or name::set(value),
// and in the second case only name::get() is supported.
// The first version van be used when the type T can be converted to and from
// a "void *", and that covers (obviously) any sort of pointer type but
// also intptr_t and uintptr_t. The second case is intended for use when the
// type T is an array or class type, and so usage will be of the form
//    name::get()[index]   or name::get().field   or name::get().member(..)
//
// The macros here may introduce a class called "name_Ref", and "name" will
// end of the name of a class (with a static member get()) rather than a
// normal symbol. Tha implementation does not always make it naturally easy
// to access the value from a debugger, and so if the symbol DEBUG is defined
// at compile-time and if C++17 inline variables are supported I will arrange
// that "name::val" holds the value in the first case and a reference to it
// in the second. If you do not have inline variables supported then
// "name::val" will be a static function that has defined within itself a
// value called Val.


// What follows supports 3 cases:
// (a) Cygwin/mingsw32 using the Microsoft thread-local API and assuming
//     that the C++ compiler supports C++17 inline variables.
// (b) Other platforms but making us of C++17 inline variables.
// (c) A fallback for use with older C++ compilers and libraries.
//


#if defined __cpp_inline_variables && \
    (defined __CYGWIN__ || defined __MINGW32__)

// With Cygwin and mingw32 (as of 2019) the support of thread-local variables
// uses a mechanism "emutls". For code that makes extensive use of such
// variables in many separate little functions this can add severe overhead.
// Microsoft provides a scheme of rather different style to support
// thread-local. Direct use of it just allows the storage of "void *" values,
// and there is a limit to how many can be stored -- although for my purposes
// the limit is plenty high enough. Here I have code fragments that activate
// the Microsoft scheme. And I go beyond that and provide inline definitions
// of machine code replacements for the low-level access procedures so that
// unless the preprocessor symbol CAUTIOUS is defined you have a chance for
// yet further savings.

// Define some utility functions for the Microsoft case...

extern "C"
{

// TlsAlloc() allocates a small integer that acts as a handle for a
// fresh thread-local. Once such a handle has been allocated TlsSetValue and
// TlsGetValue can save and load void * values from a location that it
// refers to. This location will in fact by found relative to either the FS
// or GS segment register. When the handle is no longer required it will be
// proper to cell TlsFree to release it. One can certainly not allocate more
// than 1088 handles (this value is 64+1024, and access via the first 64
// handles will be slightly cheaper than via the remaining 1024). If a
// value that you want to be thread-local can not be stored in a void * using
// TlsSetValue then it is necessary to allocate space elsewhere and set the
// Microsoft slot to point to it. I really do not want to go
// "#include <windows.h>" because that can pollute my name-space with macros
// and definitions that can clash with definitions that are otherwise
// important, and so I put in my own version of the declarations that I need.
