% This file can be run to turn bits of the REDUCE source code
% into C so that this C can be compiled and linked in to make a
% customised CSL executable that will red REDUCE faster.
%
% Run this using bootstrapreduce.img to select code to compile into C.
% The functions to be compiled are extracted from a file "profile.dat"
% that was created by "profile.red".
%
% I will also allow for a file "unprofile.dat" that can be used to provide
% extra help with modules where the module maintainer is unable to provide
% test cases that generate reliable profile date.
%
% If full_c_code is defined then rather than paying much attention
% to profile.dat it attempts to compile everything into C! Note that
% this capability causes BUGS to surface at present (I will remove this
% comment when I believe I have got past that state!) so it is just
% for hackers and experimenters.

symbolic;

% If anything goes wrong here I want a backtrace so I can debug it,
% regardless of any errorsets etc.

enable!-errorset(3, 3);

% Three major parameters are available:
%
%   fnames       a list of files to create. Making the list longer (or
%                shorter) changes the amount of C that can be created.
%                The CSL source code has to know how many there are, and
%                its current default is for 12 files.
%
%   size_per_file
%                this guides the compiler about how much to put in each
%                generated file, where the value 7000 results in each
%                file of generated C being in the range 120 to 150 Kbytes.
%
%   force_count  indicates how many functions from alg.tst statistics should
%                be included before anything else. The idea for this is
%                rooted in old days when alg.tst was *THE* Reduce test and
%                overall performance was often judged solely on how well
%                it ran. I will now make the value of force_count rather
%                small so as not to perturb more globally rational profile-
%                based judgements! But in fact most of the things that are
%                heavily used in alg.tst are used elswehere. I suspect that
%                these days the only exceptions will be the high energy
%                physics stuff. 
%

%
% Also if "how_many" is set then this will limit the total number of
% functions that are compiled into C. Since I expect to pass that via a
% command line   "-dhow_many=362"  etc I allow for it being a string
% not a number to start with. In ordinary circumstances this will not be
% used, however it has proved INVALUABLE when tracking down cases where
% compilation into C causes changes in behaviour... how_many can be used
% with a binary-chop selection process to discover exactly which function
% causes upset when compiled into C.  Of course in release quality code I
% hope there are no such cases! I will also check an environment variable
% "HOW_MANY".
