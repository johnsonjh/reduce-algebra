#ifndef header_allocate_h
#define header_allocate_h 1

// The variations guarded by "#if defined" here represent an experiment so
// that I can assess the level of extra costs that various ways of supporting
// CONS in a threaded world might incur. By dafault one gets the original
// simple version.
//
// The options are:
//  (1) Make fringe and limit registers thread_local. Then each thread would
//      have its own "nursery" area. The code as inserted here does not have
//      and extra support for the inter-thread synchronization that would
//      be needed when a nursery area became full.
//  (2) On Windows using gcc the costs of thread_local access are severe when
//      using C++ facilities. So there us code that uses the Windows native
//      thread local support API. To help speed yet further the key access
//      functions are re-implemented with a line or two of assembly code and
//      inline functions. This version also uses atomic<T> access for
//      the limit registers which would make it possible to have officially
//      correct inter-thread communication via them.
//  (3) Use of a atomic<T> value for the fringe so that a fetch_add()
//      operation on it can allocate store within a single heap segment in
//      such a way that if multiple theads all try to allocate at once
//      all remains safe. As coded here this is not actually safe because
//      I write data into the supposedly allocated region of memory before
//      checking if it overflowed the heap region. With just one thread this
//      is OK provided I ensure I have a few words spare, but with multiple
//      threads it would be a problem! In the code here I also use
//      atomic<T> for the limit register and so communication between
//      threads using it will be safe.
//  (4) Baseline code - which is what will apply unless some special pre-
//      processor symbol is defined - that uses simple C++ variables. This is
//      a very small modification and clean-up of the code used in CSL at
//      earlier times and provides something to compare the other varients
//      against.
//
// I have tried Reduce built with each of these options. In each case I ran
// the test script "susy2.tst". That test was selected because it runs for
// a noticable amount of time and turns over a fair amount of memory.
// The results I way on Windows 10 using cygwin where
//       baseline:            4.982      -
//       simple C++ threads: 13.625      THREAD_LOCAL
//       win32 thread API:    5.015      WINDOWS_THREADS
//       atomic fetch_add:    5.515      ATOMIC
// Then a similar test using defint.tst
//       baseline:           15.688
//       simple C++ threads: 33.906
//       win32 thread API:   15.704
//       atomic fetch_add:   16.469
// These figures are intended to show the overheads of the various options
// in context. On Linux the cost of C++ thread-local is minimal and on the
// Macintosh it is modest.
//
// The message I take from this is that on a x86_64 (and I believe that
// aarch64 figures are in line) use of C++ thread-local on Linus but the
// uglier Windows-special code on Cygwin/Mingw32 has really low overhead,
// but would demand multiple nursery regions. Use of atomic::fetch_add
// looks attractive but has a high local cost leading to a system-wide
// slow-down by around 10%. The naive use of C++ thread-local is obviously
// unacceptable, and I think I feel that if a change in CONS just to use
// atomic::fetch_add slows the whole system down by enough to measure
// easily in these tests I should avoid it.... it is very probable that
// in pathological cases it could lead to really dramatic slow-down.
