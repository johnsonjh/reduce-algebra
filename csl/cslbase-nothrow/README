This is cslbase-nothrow

It is all the files from cslbase but adjusted so that there should not be
any catch or throw operations that get activated during nornal use. There
can be a few that are triggered by internal failures and crashes! Also the
adaptation is at this stage experimental and while normal processing may work
all error recovery is uncertain.

The motivation here is that emscripten/jasm/webassembly carry severe
performance penalties for having code that may need to perform a "catch"
operation. Using this varient may avoid that. I want to see how much impact
I have here on both that and the normal versions of the system.

This is a whole extra copy of the directory because - as you will see by
doing a few "diff"s it makes ugly changes in many places and merging them in
to the main version using #ifdef would be disruptive. If this proves useful
I will try to decide how to tidy up and consolidate verions because having
two parallel copies of the code is asking for trouble with future changes
ending up in one not both copies.
