Files for the REDUCE web site at
http://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.net/, http://reduce-algebra.com,
etc.

This directory, namely trunk/web, in the Subversion repository
corresponds to the directory /home/project-web/reduce-algebra/ on the
web server and is the parent of the web root directory, htdocs. The
main directory structure on the web server is as shown below but not
all files and directories are checked into the repository. Files that
are missing from the repository can be obtained elsewhere or generated
from files available elsewhere in the repository. In particular, the
main REDUCE-related documentation files can be generated from source
files in the repository at trunk/doc.

SimplePie is the PHP library used to display RSS feeds and is
available from http://simplepie.org/.

Smarty is the PHP template system available from
https://www.smarty.net/. The main structural page markup is stored in
Smarty template files, into which the data in the web pages in htdocs
is inserted by Smarty.

The directory simplepie contains the SimplePie cache directory and the
directory smarty contains the Smarty cache, configuration files,
templates and cached templates. It seems that directories that need to
be writable by the web server, such as these cache directories, must
be outside htdocs.
