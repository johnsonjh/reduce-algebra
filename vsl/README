This is the VSL Lisp system. Its key attribute is that it is SMALL.
The source file (vsl.c) is around 3000 lines long, but despite that
the system can build and run much of Reduce. Since there is only
an interpreter it will be slow, but for teaching purposes and for
fun it may still be of interest.
