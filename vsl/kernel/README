The contents of this file started off as copies of the contents of
dist/kernel/AMD64_ext. They are being changed in two ways. First to
allow the code to compile using a recent version of gcc without warning
messages, and soon so that differences to support various other platforms
are merged into here with #ifdef control where that ends up essential.
The second change is intended to be part of a move towards having just one
set of C source file sto maintain in the full PSL tree.

The following files are present here copied from the source directory but
are not used while building bpsl.
   flnk_startform.h
   misc.c
   test.c
   testfloat.c
