(1) Two different definitions of a FOR macro with quite different
    behaviour.

(2) charconst for EOF conflicted between comp/macintel64/sys-consts.sl
    and comp/macintel64/sys-dm.sl. And for mingw-w64 and AMD64.

(3) lexing of numbers is inconsistent. 1+ gets parsed as a symbol while
    2#1+ is a number followed by the isolated +. 1#33 raises an error
    rather than parsing as a symbol. The issue of # within symbols is
    not that clearly consistent everywhere.

(4) printf/bldmsg are defined using some LAP code and word operations
    rendering them strongly dependent on low level PSL in a way that
    probably exceeds needs.

(5) PSL supports IF with more than 3 arguments, and my initial implementation
    followed Common Lisp and had not, leading to misery. What is worse the
    documentation of PSL suggests that symbols to be thoought of as keywords
    migh be recognized with IF...
