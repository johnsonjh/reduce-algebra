# This re-creates all the "configure" scripts and the like. It is needed
# when the machine being used does not have the same versions of autoconf
# and automake as the machine used by the developer.

#
# Usage:
#     autogen.sh [--sequential] [options as for the configure script]
#
# If no arguments are passed the script will rebuild everything. If
# --with-csl or --with-psl is specified only that section of the tree
# will be processed. In the CSL case "--with-wx", "--withoug-gui",
# and perhaps other sub-options will be checked to try to save reworking
# directories that would not be used.
