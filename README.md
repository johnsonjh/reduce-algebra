# REDUCE

## A portable general-purpose computer algebra system

----

## Introduction

**REDUCE** is an interactive system for general algebraic computations of interest to mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. It can be used interactively for simple calculations but also provides a flexible and expressive user programming language.

The development of the **REDUCE** computer algebra system was started in the 1960's by [Anthony C. Hearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_C._Hearn) and further developed by [Arthur C. Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Norman_(computer_scientist)). Since then, many scientists from all over the world have contributed to its development. **REDUCE** has a long and distinguished place in the history of computer algebra systems. Other systems that address some of the same issues but sometimes with rather different emphasis are [Axiom](http://axiom-developer.org/), [Derive](https://www.chartwellyorke.com/derive.html), [Macsyma](http://www.symbolics-dks.com/Macsyma-1.htm)/[Maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/), [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/), [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), and [MuPAD](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuPAD>).

**REDUCE** primarily runs on either _Portable Standard Lisp_ (*PSL*) or _Codemist Standard Lisp_ (*CSL*), [both of which](https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/versions.php) are included in the distribution. By modern standards, **REDUCE** is a surprisingly small and compact application, which runs well on all major operating systems.
